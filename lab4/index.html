			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to familiarize ourselves with pseudocoding tasks in order
						to help us organize our code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While my partner and I did not experience any major problems for this lab, we found it to be
						a bit challenging to think of high-level tasks when pseudocoding for the computer-game we chose
						(connect four).
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was quite effective at teaching us the importance of creating an outline for our work
						before diving head-first into an assignment. By practicing pseudocoding, we learned how to break down
						complex problems into more managable tasks that are easier to navigate through. Doing this improves the
						clarity of our approach to problems.
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<p>We successfully provided a pseudocode for an everyday task, like making spaghetti or ramen, as well as a possible
							pseudocode for a computer game, connect-four.
						</p>
						
				<pre><code>
				// Task1 : Pseucode an everyday task (Making spaghetti)
					// 1. Gather ingredients and tools
      				// Pasta noodles, olive oil, minced garlic, marinara sauce, water, salt, desired spices/herbs, ground beef
      				// Pot, saute pan, utensils (tea spoon, wooden spatula, strainer, pasta spoon)
				// 2. Boil water
      				// Fill pot with water
					// Add a couple pinches of salt to water
					// On high heat, allow water to boil
				// 3. Add pasta
					// When water comes to a rolling boil, add pasta
					// Stir noodles occasionally
					// Allow noodles to cook for 10-12 minutes
				// 4. Prepare saute pan for ground beef
					// Place saute pan on stove
					// On low to medium heat, pour a teaspoon of oil onto saute pan
					// Add a teaspoon of minced garlic for taste
					// Allow pan to heat up
				// 5. Cook ground beef
					// Add ground beef to the pan
					// Using a wooden spatula, break beef into smaller chunks/pieces
					// Continue to break down the beef as it cooks, stirring occasionally
				// 6. Season ground beef
					// Add your choice of seasonings; salt, pepper, italian seasoning, garlic salt
					// Stir to combine
				// 7. Add marinara sauce
					// Lower heat on stove for saute pan
					// Pour sauce into saute pan
					// Stir to combine sauce and beef
					// Allow it to simmer
				// 8. Turn off pan
				// 9. Drain pasta noodles
					// In a strainer, drain pasta noodles from pot
					// Stir noodles to prevent sticking
				// 10. Serve food
					// Scoop noodles into bowl
					// Top noodles with beef/marinara sauce
				// 11. Enjoy your meal!

				// Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game
				// 1. print board before each turn
					// create 6x7 grid
							// loop through each row
								// loop through each space
					// set all positions to empty
				// 2. start game loop
					// if no winner and board is empty:
							// print current board
							// player makes their move
				// 3. determine player turn
					// player 1 - red, player 2 - yellow
					// ask player to choose a column
					// check if column is empty
							// if column is valid, drop piece to the lowest space in row
							// if column is invalid, ask player to pick again
							// loop through each turn
				// 5. check for win or draw condition
					// horizontal
					// veritical
					// diagonal
					// if all spaces are filled with no winner, declare draw
				// 6. end game
					// announce winner or draw
