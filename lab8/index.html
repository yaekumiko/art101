			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of this lab was to work with our partner and experiment with anonymous functions
                        and callbacks.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble getting my inspector to show the output of my JS file correctly. Turns out I had some
                        syntax errors that I had to go back and fix. Another issue I experienced was getting my CSS to
                        show on my page at first but luckily it was an easy thing to resolve. I attempted to do the Task X
                        step to get my function to display using jQuery but I was having a hard time navigating what I should
                        do to get it to display correctly on my HTML.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was quite fun to do and challenging in a good way. I'm still learning how functions work
                        and how to correctly call a variable, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it and
                        a solidfying my understanding of anonymous functions and callbacks.
