			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div class="special-sections" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to work with our partner, experiment with jQuery,
						and create a button for the challenge, problems, and results section for the user
						to 'make special'.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="special-sections" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first I had some problems getting the buttons to show up, but I realized that there
						were minor syntax errors that prevented it from displaying on my page. For instance,
						I was referring to special-sections as an id by using the hashtag (#) #special-sections, 
						instead of correctly calling it as a class by using (.) '.special-sections'
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had fun experimenting with buttons on my page and learning how to code for them. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="special-sections" id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Click the button 'make special' to see the results!</p>
                    <div id="output"></div>
