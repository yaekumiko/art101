			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with basic JavaScript data types
						and variables, allowing us to experiment with them for better understanding.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have any major problems doing the JavaScript variables, but I did run
						into a slight issue trying to upload an image of the car I mentioned in the script output.
						Other than that, there wasn't much worth mentioning that set me back from completing this lab.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I took CSE20 before despite not even actually being a CSS major, so reviewing some of the 
						datatypes and variables for JavaScript is a nice refresher to remember how each line of code works.
						I feel like I have a better understanding of using Chrome's inspector and what it's like to work with
						JavaScript in the console.
