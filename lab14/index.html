                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to use our debugging knowledge to fix past labs.</p>

            <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I didn't really have any labs that needed to be debugged, so instead I went back and added minor details
                    to past labs. I played around with CSS and JS a lot, and occasionally referenced Wes's code for the labs
                    that I made canges to.

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Results are pretty minor and consist of basic CSS changes there were made to some of my past labs.</p>
