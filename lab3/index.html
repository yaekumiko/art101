			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to create a local file structure and upload the files to its designated server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My partner and I ran into some confusion about the lab instructions because we had our own interpretations of the task at hand. After further consultation,
						we eventually sorted out the issue and successfully determined what we had to do for this assignment. One technical problem my partner ran into was 
						creating an unordered bulleted list of our labs. Fortunately, I was able to help my partner and guide them through 
						their code. A personal problem I encountered was the 'bonus' task of creating a CSS script for my homepage and editing
						it. I was stuck on how to make my image fit and float, but through trial and error, and honest consultation
						with W3Schools and ChatGPT, I was able to overcome this problem.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I encountered a small obstacle when trying to upload images to my files, but I realized it was a simple task I overlooked
						and figured it out on my own by putting two-and-two together.

					<h2>Results</h2>
