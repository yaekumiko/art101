			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to create a local file structure and upload the files to its designated server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One technical problem my partner ran into was creating an unordered bulleted list of our labs. Fortunately, 
						I was able to guide my partner through their code and provide a successful solution. A personal problem 
						I encountered was the 'bonus' task of creating a CSS script for my homepage and editing it. I was stuck on 
						how to make my image fit and float, but through trial and error, and honest consultation with W3Schools and ChatGPT,
						I was able to overcome this problem.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was particularly challenging because my partner and I often got confused with some of the tasks for the assignment.
						We had to consult with one another over Facetime and further discuss our issues to come up with solutions so that we were
						both on the same page. I'm not feeling super confident with the end results, but I hope that our work is close to accurate
						and matches what the professor is looking for in this lab.
					</p>
