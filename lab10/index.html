                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab is to work with our partner and experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>At first I was having some issues getting the random text generator on my JavaScript file
                    to show up in the output of my html site, but turns out there were some syntax errors and
                    lines of code I accidentally repeated twice.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id=reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This lab was easy to navigate and work through, though there were times when
                    I had to stop and really think about understanding the lines of code that was provided
                    on the Canvas assignment page. Nevertheless, I feel that I am solidifying my understanding
                    of DOM manipulation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section" id="results">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Click the 'Say something' button to see the results!</p>
            <div id="output"></div>
            <button id="make-convo">Say something</button>
