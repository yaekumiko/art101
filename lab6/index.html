			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with arrays and objects in Chrome's inspector, working specifically
						with examples from our own personal modes of transportation.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One issue I had when working on the inspector is that I kept putting a semicolon (;) after the objects 
						instead of a comma (,) which returned an error in the inspector so I had to go back and make sure that I
						was using the correct punctuation/symbol.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was fairly easy and straight forward, though I am not looking forward to when things get a little
						more complicated. Other than that, this lab made realize that a part of me is heavily interested in how code
						works for the different languages.
