			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Hajimemashite! I am Miki Foster, a 4th year Linguistics major.
				My partner is Nadya Boguslavsky, a 3rd year Sociology major.
				The two of us formally met on the first day of class and coincidentally
				are in the same section for this course. Since then, Nadya and I have
				been working together to complete the labs as best as we can to our
				abilities. Neither Nadya nor I have much of a coding background, but we
				are willing to challenge ourselves and expand our knowledge.
