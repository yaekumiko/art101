			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The objective of this lab was to work with our partner, write functions that take a user's input
						and manipulate a string.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One issue that I was struggling with was getting my window.prompt() to show up properly on my lab7 html page.
						Luckily, comparing my code side-by-side with my partner's helped me to figure out and spot the small errors in
						my JS. Another thing that I found challenging was converting a string to an array. I had to consult with W3Schools
						and used the example in Canvas as a reference to guide me. I think with some more practice and time to play
						around with the code will help clarify any confusion I have.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was on the challenging side, for me personally, but thanks to my partner I was able to complete the
						assignment and tasks at hand.
					</p>
